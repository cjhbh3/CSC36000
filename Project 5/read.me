Bugs: It finds the biggest numbers, but it has no way to check if that leads to the maximum sum.
Results in a smaller number than expected.
Summary: This was a hard project to wrap my head around. I wasn't too sure how to check if the number
summed is the maximum given. However, once I found a good idea of how to start attacking the problem, I
made an algorithm that was able to divide it into 9 innings and get pretty close to the final answer.
Log: I have some comments in my main that showed my process for possible solutions.
