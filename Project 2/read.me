Bugs: For some reason I am getting an issue with a 
Segmentation Fault when printing the entire stack.
Summary: I started with implementing the stack,
which was straight forward. When working on the
Statement classes, it was hard to understand what
was meant, but once I got the first two working, I had
a good idea on how to finish.
