Bugs: None that I know of.
Summary: I started by creating two classes, a TreeNode and a BinaryTree. 
The TreeNode would host the value, the height, and then pointers for the left and right children.
The BinaryTree class would have a TreeNode representing the root. After that, it was
as simple as implementing functions for inserting AVL style and inserting unbalanced style.
Along with some helper functions.
