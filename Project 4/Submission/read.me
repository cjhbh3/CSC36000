Bugs: None that I know of.
Summary: I started by creating two structs, Object and ClosestPair. Once that was done, I worked on
taking input from the file and storing it as an array of Objects. Next, I started working
on the Closest() function which would work to generate a smallest distance and a strip from the
midpoint of points. Finally, I implemented a function to find the ClosestPair in the strip and 
compared that answer to the smallest distance we got in Closest().
